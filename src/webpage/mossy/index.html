  went on to defeat another fellow pupil and average Fortnite Player ManaFN (Harvy T).Mossy Continued his school life
  unbothered by mere mortals other than when his computerscience teacher MR S said "Mossy I swear you get bullied

  <h2>Short TV Career</h2>
</div>
<div class="parag5">
  <p5>Whilst at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomlinscote_School">Tomlinscote Secondary School</a> Mossy was
    signed up by another pupil (Oliver Newport a handsome devil) to the popular TV show <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apprentice_(British_TV_series)">"The Apprentice"</a>. Oliver wrote his
    application as a mere joke, adding Callum had a second personality Mossy . However Oliver failed to realise TVs
    desperation for content and Mossy was quickly accepted . Oliver went on to send in a photo of Mossy in his school
    uniform which was then accepted aswell ,baring in mind you had to be 18 to enter.Mossy was then offered an interview
    in London which he sadly did not attend thus ending his short tv career .</p5>
